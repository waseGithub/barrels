Created on 2020/12
Author: Jahns_P
Version Number: 3
Date of last change: 2022/08/09
Requires: HMC804x, FW 1.400 or newer and adequate options
- Installed RsInstrument Python module 1.50 or newer
- Installed VISA e.g. R&S Visa 5.12.x or newer
Description: Setup CH1 and log to a file for a certain time, transfer the log file to the local PC
General Information:
Please always check this example script for unsuitable setting that may
destroy your DUT before connecting it to the instrument!
This example does not claim to be complete. All information has been
compiled with care. However, errors can not be ruled out.
